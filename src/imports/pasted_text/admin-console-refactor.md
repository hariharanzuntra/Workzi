Refine the existing Admin Console instead of redesigning it.

Do NOT regenerate the project from scratch.

Keep the existing design system, components, typography (Roboto), colors, spacing, Auto Layout, variables, and interaction model.

This prompt should MODIFY the existing project to align with the finalized product architecture.

────────────────────────────────────

SOURCE OF TRUTH

The attached Admin Mobile IA v1.3 and Organization IA are the single source of truth.

The Web application must follow the same Information Architecture, business rules, terminology, and navigation.

Do NOT invent new enterprise modules.

Desktop should be an extension of the mobile experience, not a different product.

────────────────────────────────────

REMOVE THESE MODULES COMPLETELY

Remove every reference to:

• Payroll

• Salary Components
• Payslips
• PF
• ESI

Desktop may use a left sidebar instead of bottom navigation, but the structure must remain identical.

Instead add

Split Views

Advanced Filters

Bulk Actions

Tables

Analytics

Export

Import

Keyboard Shortcuts

Resizable Panels

────────────────────────────────────

INTERACTIONS

Every interaction should remain functional.

Every button

Every icon

Every row

Every card

Every tab

Every dropdown

Every menu

Every breadcrumb

Every notification

Every drawer

Every modal

Every quick action

Every AI action

must navigate to an existing screen or execute a meaningful workflow.

No dead links.

No placeholder pages.

────────────────────────────────────

Maintain the existing visual style.

Do not redesign the UI.

Only restructure the product to match the finalized Admin IA while preserving the current premium enterprise appearance.
