Continue refining the existing Admin Web application.

Do NOT redesign the application.

Do NOT regenerate Login, Authentication, Onboarding, Global Navigation, My Space or Team.

Assume the administrator has completed onboarding and is using the application daily.

The attached Mobile IA is the ONLY source of truth.

Follow the Mobile IA exactly.

Desktop should only enhance the experience using desktop patterns such as:

• Data Tables
• Split Views
• Bulk Actions
• Advanced Filters
• Drawers
• Multi-column Layouts
• Context Menus

Never introduce new modules.

Never change the navigation hierarchy.

OBJECTIVE

Build the complete Organization module.

This module is the administration hub of the application.

It should allow administrators to configure and manage the organization while maintaining a clean, enterprise-grade experience.

The experience should feel similar to Atlassian Admin and Linear while using interaction ideas inspired by Zoho People.

Do NOT copy Zoho's UI or Information Architecture.

Complete every screen, state, interaction, and workflow for the Organization module before proceeding to the next prompt.
