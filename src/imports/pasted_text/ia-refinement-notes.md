Refine the existing Admin Web application.

Do NOT redesign the application.

Do NOT regenerate onboarding, authentication, global navigation, design system, components, colors, typography, or layouts.

Maintain the current design language, Roboto typography, Auto Layout, reusable components, spacing, variables, and interactions.

This is an Information Architecture refinement only.

OBJECTIVE

Separate SELF-SERVICE features from ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT.

The application should clearly distinguish:

• My Data (Self)
• Organization Data (Administration)

The Mobile IA remains the source of truth.

Do NOT change the left sidebar navigation.

Instead, reorganize content inside My Space and Organization.

────────────────────────────────────

MY SPACE

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

My Space = Self Service

Team = Team Collaboration

Organization = Administration

Ensure every interaction, filter, table, calendar, timeline, approval, and detail page follows this principle.

Maintain the current design system.

Maintain responsiveness.

Maintain production-quality interactions.

Do not regenerate unrelated screens.

Only refactor the Information Architecture and navigation flow to separate SELF and ORGANIZATION contexts while preserving the existing visual design.
